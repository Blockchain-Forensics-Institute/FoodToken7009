üçΩÔ∏è **Food Token System**

## Overview

The Food Token System is a blockchain-based application that allows users to register, generate QR codes for food tokens, and redeem them via an admin panel. The system includes a smart contract (ERC-20) to handle token transactions and a web interface for user interactions.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register with their name, email, and phone number and receive food tokens.
- **Login & Dashboard**: Users can log in to view their token balance and generate a QR code.
- **QR Code Generation**: A QR code is created for each registered user containing their details.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can scan QR codes to redeem tokens for food distribution.
- **Blockchain-based Token System**: Smart contract implementation using ERC-20 for managing food tokens.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Blockchain**: Solidity (ERC-20 token contract)
- **Database**: JSON file-based storage
- **QR Code Handling**: `qrcode` library & OpenCV

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/food-token-system.git
cd food-token-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Backend (Node.js Server)
```sh
cd server
npm install
```

#### Frontend (Python Streamlit App)
```sh
cd token-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application

#### Start Backend Server
```sh
cd server
node index.js
```

#### Start Frontend Streamlit App
```sh
cd webapp
streamlit run app.py
```

### 4. Smart Contract Deployment
- Use **Remix IDE** to deploy `token.sol`.
- Ensure you have a wallet connected (e.g., MetaMask).
- Deploy the contract and interact with it to issue tokens.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**: Users enter their details and receive a QR code with token balance.
2. **Login & QR Display**: Users log in and see their QR code representing their tokens.
3. **Admin Token Redemption**: The admin scans QR codes and deducts tokens accordingly.
4. **Blockchain Transaction**: Token transactions occur via the deployed smart contract.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with a real database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB)
- Improved authentication (OAuth, JWT)
- Mobile app integration
- Real blockchain deployment instead of a local setup
